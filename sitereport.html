        <h2>My Experience in Web Development</h2>
        <p>Web Development journey has been crucial and tough for me within this journey I have learnt a lot of things. First of all, I was very much unaware of these coding things but slowly and gradually I have learnt a lot of things regarding Web Development. It was a fun and a lot of informative session throughout these classes where I got to learn a lot of things which I implemented doing the assignment. I learnt from writing the header to make the footer of the page. I learnt from the beginning to giving a proper shape to the website.I was facing a lot of ups and downs as I was never used to with these kind of things. So, throughout this time I was getting a lot of problems like when I used to change the single component of the website the whole website was unmanaged and like these condition other condition also arose in learning process. Our Lecturer taught us dividing into parts and taught once at a time. So, it was easy for me to learn in process. Sometimes it made me restless too but looking at the changes that occur in the screen it was so pleasing to the eyes. It was a long process to learn these things but along it time it dragged me to give a basic knowledge about HTML and CSS. It took me certain time to get used to with this and once I get used to with this it was easy for me to get. </p>
